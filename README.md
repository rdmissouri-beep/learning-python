# learning-python

This repository contains my exercises, notes, and small projects as I build my Python fundamentals and grow toward more advanced AI engineering concepts.

### What you'll find here:
- Basic Python practice (loops, functions, classes, file handling)
- Small hands-on exercises
- Learning notes from Real Python and other resources
- Early experiments tied to my AI Engineer learning plan

More projects will be added as I continue leveling up.
